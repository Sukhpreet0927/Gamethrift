# Gamethrift
Gamethrift is an application that empowers users to search for specific games and provides information about the platforms on which they are available. Users can also easily identify which games are currently offered for free or at a discounted price. This project leverages the RAWG API to access these details.

# Goal
The primary goal of this app is to provide users with accurate information about a specific game's availability across various platforms. With the proliferation of gaming platforms, it has become increasingly challenging to determine which platforms support a particular game. The search feature addresses this issue by allowing users to effortlessly retrieve this information. The app integrates with the RAWG API to facilitate the game search.

# Future
In the future, I plan to implement a cross-play section in this GUI app. This enhancement will enable users to quickly identify if a game is accessible across multiple platforms, further enhancing the user experience.
